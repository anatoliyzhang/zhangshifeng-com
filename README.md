## 🌟 Core Architecture

EZ EDGE CMS operates on the principle that the network edge should handle both logic and data. This approach solves the trade-offs between static site generation speed and traditional dynamic CMS flexibility.

- **Zero Build Latency**: Content updates and configuration changes are reflected globally across the edge instantly, bypassing long CI/CD build queues.
- **Isolate-Optimized**: Engineered with isolate-level in-memory caching and native Web APIs to maximize efficiency and minimize execution costs.
- **Programmatic Design System**: A HSL-driven visual engine allows for full brand identity shifts through simple configuration overrides.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

The project utilizes a focused stack of lightweight, modern web technologies:

- **[Hono](https://hono.dev/)**: Ultra-fast web framework optimized for edge environments.
- **[Cloudflare KV](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/)**: Low-latency global key-value storage for content persistence.
- **[UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/)**: On-demand atomic CSS engine featuring high-performance isolate caching.
- **[HTMX](https://htmx.org/)**: Enables a responsive, SPA-like Administrative HUD with minimal client-side overhead.
- **[Editor.js](https://editorjs.io/)**: A block-based semantic editor providing a modern content creation experience.
